# PacMan-Exercise


## Title of the Project: 
PacMac Exercise

## Description of the Project
There are two buttons in the top left corner (Add PacMan and Start Game). The Add PacMan button creates a PacMan for every click. When you start the game the PacMen will travel at random speeds and trajectories to the right until they hit the right boarder and then will reverse directions.

## How to Run/Usage (Installation)
Once the files are downloaded (clone) the HTML file index should be loaded in a Web Browser. Once loaded with a click of the button "Add PacMan" a PacMan will be created. The desired amount of PacMen will based on the amount of clicks of that button. Once ready you can start the game. The speed of the PacMen will increase if the Start Game button is clicked more than once. Refresh your browser to clear the "board."

## Roadmap of future improvements
Add a stop button
Reverse the image to face the direction the PacMan is traveling.
