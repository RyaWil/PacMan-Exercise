## Description of the Project

## How to Run/Usage (Installation)
Once the files are downloaded (clone) the HTML file should be loaded in a Web Browser. With a click of the button "Show stops between MIT and Harvard" there will be an animation of the bus stops from MIT to Harvard. A bubble/pin will appear and move every two seconds.

## Roadmap of future improvements
Add a reset button to move the pin back to the beginning point.
Add a reverse path from Harvard to MIT
